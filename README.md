# PROJECT PARANOIA
An AI model.

It really made no sense to do this in Java instead of C/C++ (mainly because I like passing things into functions with a &).
Don't blame me! I like IntelliJ IDEA and I can't use Visual Studio for the moment!
The Paranobot class is supposed to be the core class (Who am I fooling? I just wanted some cool name for the main method).
The Thought class is supposed to be classes that are going to be serialized by first wrapping them into an idea class to the drive, or, used with <i>nodes</i> to be communicated and modified.
The Node instances are equivalent to neurons.
The Interface class is the class that will handle interacting with the user.
The Logger class is in charge of writing/outputting what is happening.

PS: This is nothing serious, just a way for practicing my coding skills.
