# PROJECT PARANOIA
An AI model.

It really made no sense to do this in Java instead of C/C++.
Don't blame me! I like IntelliJ IDEA and I can't use Visual Studio for the moment!
The Paranobot class is supposed to be the core class, and the Thought class is supposed to be classes that are going to be serialized, sometimes (sometimes? It's a surprise).
